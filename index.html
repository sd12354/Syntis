      <p>Rahul Dhanda</p>
      <p class="founder">CEO, President, Director</p>
      <p id="rahulBio"class="smallTxt">Rahul Dhanda is co-founder, ceo and director of Syntis Bio. Previously, Rahul co-founded Sherlock Biosciences in early 2018, where he initially acquired exclusive rights to CRISPR and SynBio platforms for molecular diagnostics. As the founding CEO, President and Director, Rahul scaled the company by building a diverse and accomplished team to reach commercialization of the first-ever CRISPR product, diagnostic or therapeutic, to be authorized by the FDA. He also directed the rapid advancement of the company’s SynBio platform towards the goal of being the first at-home, instrument-free molecular diagnostic. He secured over $55 million in capital, including $25 million in non-dilutive funding in the company’s Series A.

        Under his leadership, Sherlock Biosciences has been named a Fast Company Most Innovative Company in 2021 (Top 10 in Biotech), a Red Herring Top 100 Company, Fierce15 MedTech, Tech Pioneer by the World Economic Forum, and Top 50 Innovative Company by BostonInno, among others. Rahul was named to Boston’s Power50 list by the Boston Business Journal in 2020.
        
        As a strong advocate of equity in society and STEM, Rahul founded The 221b Foundation, a non-profit organization that provides access to CRISPR intellectual property for COVID-19 diagnostics, the profits of which are invested in STEM education initiatives promoting gender and racial diversity.
        
        Prior to Sherlock Biosciences, Rahul helped build T2 Biosystems over ten years, resulting in a publicly-traded, commercial leader in infectious disease diagnostics. As Senior Vice President of Corporate Development and Marketing, he led multiple strategic and commercial initiatives including marketing, product management and all partnering activity, including over $40 million in deals. Prior to T2, Rahul worked at various diagnostic and medical device firms, including Boston Scientific where he managed over $100 million in product revenue.
        
        Rahul earned his MBA from MIT’s Sloan School of Management and his B.A. from Wesleyan University. He is a former committee member of the AAAS Committee on Scientific Freedom and Responsibility. Mr. Dhanda is the author of several publications, an inventor on numerous patents, and has authored the first book to address the crossroads between industry and bioethics/public policy, entitled Guiding Icarus: Merging Bioethics with Corporate Interests.

      <p>Giovanni Traverso, MB, BChir, PhD</p>
      <p class="founder">Chair Clin. Advisory Board, Director</p>
      <p id="gioBio"class="smallTxt">Dr. Traverso is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and in the Division of Gastroenterology, Brigham and Women’s Hospital (BWH), Harvard Medical School. Dr. Traverso grew up in Peru, Canada and the United Kingdom.  He received his BA from Trinity College, University of Cambridge, UK, and his PhD from the lab of Prof. Bert Vogelstein at Johns Hopkins University.  He subsequently completed medical school at the University of Cambridge, internal medicine residency at the Brigham and Women’s Hospital and his gastroenterology fellowship training at Massachusetts General Hospital, both at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Traverso’s previous work focused on the development of novel molecular tests for the early detection of colon cancer. For his post-doctoral research, he transitioned to the fields of chemical and biomedical engineering in the laboratory of Professor Robert Langer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he developed a series of novel technologies for drug delivery as well as physiological sensing via the gastrointestinal tract.
        Dr. Traverso’s work has been published in the New England Journal of Medicine, The Lancet, the Journal of the American Medical Association, Science, Nature, Science, Nature Biotechnology, Nature Materials, Nature Communications, Science Translational Medicine and Cancer Research.  He has been the recipient of the Grand Prize of the Collegiate Inventors Competition, a Research Fellowship from Trinity College, and was named one of the most promising innovators under 35 by the MIT Tech Review’s TR 35. In 2020 he was recognized by Wired Magazine as one of the changemakers of tomorrow who is helping build a better world.
        His current research program is focused on developing the next generation of drug delivery systems to enable efficient delivery of therapeutics through the gastrointestinal tract as well developing novel ingestible electronic devices for sensing a broad array of physiologic and pathophysiologic parameters.  Additionally, Dr. Traverso continues his efforts towards the development of novel diagnostic tests that enable the early detection of cancer.
        Dr. Traverso is a co-founder of Lyndra Therapeutics, Vivtex, Suono Bio, Celero Systems, Bilayer Therapeutics, Teal Bio.  He is also a co-founder of Project Prana, a not-for-profit focused on education and deployment of systems capable of expanding ventilator support globally in the setting of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
